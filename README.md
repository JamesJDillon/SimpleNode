# SimpleNode

I've been doing a lot of small REST APIs recently, so I thought it would be worthwhile to make a little starter project to save me the hassle of starting
from scratch every time.

The libraries and technologies used are:

* **NodeJS** *(runtime)*
* **TypeScript** *(Types extension for JS)*
* **ESLint** *(Linter)*
* **Express** *(web application framework)*
* **Prisma** *(ORM)*
* **SQLite** *(database)*

## Running


## Structure

### Config Structure

| File      | Purpose     |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **.env.example** | An example environment file. Modify this and delete the .example extension. |
| **.eslintrc.json** | Configurations for the ESLint linter. |
| **.gitignore** | Git configurations, what folders and files to ignore.  |
| **package-lock.json** | Automatically generated by NPM, contains a snapshot of the dependency tree. Do not touch. |
| **nodemon.json** | Contains project dependencies, scripts etc. |
| **README.md** | You're reading it right now. Very meta. |
| **tsconfig.json** | Contains Typescript configurations. |
